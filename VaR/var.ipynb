    "Afin de déterminer le seuil optimal, il ne doit pas être trop bas pour éviter d’inclure des données trop fréquentes, ni trop élevé afin de conserver suffisamment d'observations pour une modélisation fiable. Pour cette raison, un seuil minimal est fixé au quantile d'ordre 90% et un seuil maximal au quantile 99%. Avec un pas ajustable de 0.0001, nous explorons la plage de valeurs comprises entre u_min et u_max. Pour chaque seuil, nous estimons les paramètres de la loi GPD. Nous calculons ensuite les écarts absolus entre les estimations successives des paramètres scale et shape. Ces écarts sont additionnés pour chaque seuil afin de mesurer la stabilité des estimations. Le seuil optimal correspond à celui où la somme de ces écarts est minimale, indiquant une stabilité maximale des paramètres estimés."
